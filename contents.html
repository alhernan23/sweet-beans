                    [AUTHOR'S NOTE:] My friends and I are outside the box. I myself have been outside the box for my whole life. 
                    In school, I did not fit in with the other “normal people.” My personality is nerdy, 
                    introverted, and awkward, which nobody had an interest in. Those who did only stayed a 
                    brief moment and left. However there was a fateful encounter in the fall of 2017, and 
                    eventually, more followed. These people were not like the others; they were also outside 
                    of the box, just like me. 
                 <p>
                    These written files and music files, all written by my friends and myself, have been compiled not only in honor of my friends, but to show our unique friend 
                    group dynamic. We do not think like normal people, nor do we act like normal people. 
                    Out of the 7 billion in the world, we are one of the individuals whose brains are wired 
                    differently. We see differently. We think differently. You think one way, we think the 
                    other. It's been theorized we share a brain cell (and the rumor might as well be true).
                </p>
                 <p>
                    A lot of kids are scared of how people view them, because of their “weird” personalities. 
                    But, there are so many of us out there. It's just a matter of the right place and time to 
                    find them.
