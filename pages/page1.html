        talked.

        <p>I'm wearing my duck socks today! They aren't very warm, but they have ducks on them. 
            So that's pretty cool, I guess.

        <p>I have a dream! I want to be the best game designer ever. 
            I'm taking really hard cs classes right now and I've been drawing a bunch to practice. 
            My greatest obstacle right now is being distracted by great games. Instead of making 
            games or learning how to make games, I've been playing great games like Pokémon and 
            overwatch! As much as I want to be a great game designer, i am a competitor. I love 
            playing competitive games and trying to be the best at them. Right now, I'm obsessed
            with overwatch and just recently broke gm… instead being on top of my homework
