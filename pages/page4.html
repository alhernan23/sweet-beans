        <p>My dream was always to make something that had an impact on others. As someone who grew up 
            with video games, manga, and animation, I was fascinated by the music and art these forms of 
            media have. I've always wanted to recreate these emotions with my own art, whether it be digital 
            art, games etcâ€¦. This goal is something I constantly aspired to achieve. If I were to impact 
            even a small number of people with something I created, I would be extremely happy.
        </p>
        <p>Did I make progress in this goal? I am not entirely sure. I have created a lot of art 
            but I always feel like I can make something bigger. However, I am really proud of the art I 
            made so far. Even though I struggle to grow, I would feel so happy if someone compliments my art. 
            After hours of work, one like can easily make my day.
        </p>
        <p>Now, my relationship with art is something that has impacted my life in a numerous amount of ways. 
            A big part of my relationship with art is that it is a bit of an escape. Loneliness is something 
            that creeps up during breaks (Winter and Spring). With breaks comes a lot of free time. However, 
            with social media breaks comes the expectation that you should be socializing. Now with social 
            anxiety, reaching out to talk with others was difficult. Because of this, I used all my free time 
            on art. Making progress on art gave my purpose. Every day I used to constantly grind and figure 
            out ways to improve my art. I watched youtube videos, learned 3d, shot-compositions, watched films, 
            followed artists, and did everything I could to get better. And I did get better and I enjoyed every 
            second of it. Listening to music while sketching and being stuck in this imaginative world is something 
            I absolutely love. 
        </p>
        <p>Although my life with art was generally full of solitude, I enjoyed the solitude. But of course, 
            feeling lonely was something not very comfy. As a result, whenever I posted an art post on instagram, 
            I felt really happy because I can share and connect with others, even if it is through a simple like or 
            comment. As time went on, I started connecting to more people with art and started to feel less lonely. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So to add on top of my dream of creating something really cool, I really want to do it while meeting 
            and talking with others. I really would love to make short films and make games with others and I would 
            do anything I can to achieve that goal.
