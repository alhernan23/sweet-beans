        <p>
            Ya wanna know something? I'm writing this shit at 5:15 AM. Yes, I'm serious, that's the time right now. 
            Why? Can't sleep. Never really could sleep before 5 AM and now I can't even fall asleep now, so I'm 
            writing in this document in some vain hope that it'll get me tired enough to pass out. As such, I'm 
            just gonna ad-lib this entire thing. -. --- / ..-. .. .-.. - . .-. , just words-to-keyboard. It's better 
            that way, .. / .--. .-. --- -- .. ... .
        </p>
        <p>I used to think something was fundamentally wrong with me. That there was something ... --- / -... .-. --- -.- . -.
            about me to the very core, that I couldn't even perform this literal unconscious task properly. I don't know if 
            that's where I began to start doubting myself, but it certainly hasn't ended, so who knows? Maybe there 
            really is something fundamentally broken about me. It was certainly right with the sleep part. Apparently 
            some part of -- -.-- / -... .-. .- .. -. doesn't shut off properly, so my entire neural network ends up in a perpetual state 
            of “waiting for application to close” when I try to sleep, like that one file with no name that keeps 
            appearing only when you try to shut your computer down. God, I hate those things. Making me push like 
            two more buttons.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe it's one of the reasons I'm ... --- / .-.. --- -. . .-.. -.-- Don't get me wrong, you're all great company, and I'd 
            gladly die over and over for all of you, you've all earned at least that. However, I know somewhere in 
            me there's a capacity for a relationship far above what any of you can give me. That's not a bad thing…it 
            just makes me wonder sometimes if all the inert ..-. .-.. .- .-- ... in my body's programming that have just lingered over 
            the course of 19 and a half years has had anything to do with my romantic luck.
        </p>
        <p>Wow, jeez, .... . .- ...- -.-- / - .- .-.. -.- there, Spencer. You're depressing the crowd for god's sake! Alright, uh, something funny, 
            or whatever. Right, I'm learning to draw! I suck, right now, mainly because I'm drawing with a mouse and 
            I have no plans to get a tablet, or one of those fancy USB plug-in drawing things you can use to turn your 
            computer into a fancy iPad, or whatever. I want to learn how to draw with a mouse. It will take longer, yes, 
            and undeniably be worse than if I were to just give in and get a damn drawing tablet or something. Mama didn't 
            raise no quitter. I started drawing with a mouse and I'm gonna die with a mouse in my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright, I guess that's long enough. I have a tendency to --- ...- . .-. - .- .-.. -.- , wouldn't you know? More broken bits 
            of code someone slotted into the part of my brain that was presumably supposed to be where my anxiety 
            suppressant program was supposed to go. Anyway, I'm going to bed. Not to sleep, but probably just to lay 
            there until it's morning. Knowing the time, it's probably a bit too late for that anyway.
        </p>
        <p>…darn, I just made the thing even longer. ... --- .-. .-. -.-- I'll shut up now.
