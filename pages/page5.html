        <p>I've had a really busy past week. I've been working almost nonstop, in class, 
            doing homework, prepping for tests, practicing my instruments, playing in 
            rehearsal, etc. But despite being super busy with 9-14 hour work days, I still 
            love the things I'm doing. Well most of them, a few are a little more meh in 
            comparison. But I just had my first concert of the semester today. I felt like 
            I made a few mistakes throughout, but the feedback from my friends in the audience 
            was nothing but positivity, and it put into perspective that the 4-5 things I 
            messed up on, are nothing compared to the hundreds of things that I worked so 
            hard to get right. And my main thing isn't even performing. Putting in the tens 
            of hours a week is a lot and tiring, but it's worth it to be able to do the 
            things I'm experiencing.
