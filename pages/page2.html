            I'm trying to find the right words
        to comfort you and take away this feeling.
        But nothing come to my mind
        except for “I'm sorry.”
        I can never find the right words
        to take away this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know what it's like
        to be where you are.
        But I do know I love you.
        And I want to see you happy.
        I want to find the right words.
    </p>

<p>
    The right words.
    The right words.
    right words..
    words…
</p>

<p>
    Why can't I find the words?
    The ones you need to hear.
    Like everything will be okay, but the truth.
    I wanna take away your pain, your suffering
    and make it my own.
</p>


<p>
    It shouldn't be happening.
    It shouldn't be happening.
    shouldn't be happening.
    wrong- all wrong- no no no
</p>

<p>
    Why is this happening?
    I don't know.
    I don't want you to be unhappy
    -can't be unhappy-
    I want you to be you again.
    Happy, smiley you.
    I can tell you're trying to be strong,
    but how much longer can you go?
    I don't want something bad to happen to you.
    Please be okay.
    If not for yourself, then for me.
    Be okay while I try to find the right words.
    Be okay while I try to find the words to help.
    While I try to find the words…
