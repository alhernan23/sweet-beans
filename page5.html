        <p>You should learn how to love yourself before you love someone else. You 
            don't depend on someone to give you that love. You can depend on them to 
            help you, but nobody will make you feel complete like *that.* “Well I don't
            love myself at all” is a lie you tell yourself. Because in fact, 
            you actually DO love yourself and you just can't recognize it. If you 
            think about it, you don't ACTUALLY want to disappear from the world. You 
            know deep down there is at least person who will mourn your death. If you 
            keep living life, that means you have some love for yourself deep down and 
            you just need to embrace it. “I'm ugly. I'm out of shape. I'm not talented” 
            are all lies. That's your brain tricking you. You've gotta dig deeper and 
            isten to what your heart is feeling. Your heart carries more empathy for 
            yourself than your brain. Your brain is so weird. I get that. So you look 
            into your heart. “It's all in your head” is exactly right. Remember how 
            people used to tell you that, saying that you'll get it over it? Well they 
            were right the whole time. It really is just all in your head. You've gotta 
            push out all the negative things to the side and find your true feelings
            about yourself. You LOVE yourself. Your heart is waiting for you to realize 
            that. There's not really a person you SHOULD be. Rather it's the person you 
            WANT to be. And in all honesty, nobody knows the person they want to be. 
            Your whole life is gonna be figuring things out and that's the way it's 
            supposed to be. You never really fully solve something and then move on. 
            Everything is a learning process, your whole life is one. Living life = 
            figuring things out. You can do a lot of actions to figure things out. 
            Try new foods to see what you like, travel to a new place to find out if 
            you like that place, listen to new music to see if you like it. And you 
            can mix it up with your old interests. What if I try this food with this 
            one? How about I travel to this place and then stop by my favorite place? 
            What if I mashed up my new favorite song and an oldie?</p>
