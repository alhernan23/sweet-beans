        <p>As we all know, Halloween always takes place on the last day of October, every October 31st.
        Although it seems like Halloween should only be 24 hours per year, thanks to time zones, any 
        given date is actually taking place somewhere for 48 hours total. That's because the two time 
        zones that separate the earliest time and latest time are exactly 24 hours apart. That means 
        that Halloween lasts 24 hours in the earliest time zone, and as soon as it becomes November 1st, 
        Halloween starts in the latest time zone, lasting an additional 24 hours, thus getting us to our 
        total of 48 hours of Halloween per year. However, you may have realized that 48 hours per year 
        is still far from always being Halloween, and you'd be right to think so. Allow me to explain, 
        but to do so, we need to leave the atmosphere and go into outer space. As you may already know, 
        when we see the sun, we aren't seeing the sun in its exact current form. We are actually looking 
        into the past. Due to the distance between the sun and Earth and the speed of light, it actually 
        takes about 8 minutes for the sun's light to reach Earth. This applies to all the stars we can 
        see in they sky at night too. They are so far away, that the light from some of them take years 
        to reach Earth. Some of them may no longer exist. And by using this logic, you can guess there 
        from a certain distance away from Earth, your view of Earth would be in that 48 hour window in 
        which Halloween takes place on Earth. However, the universe is always expanding, so as you go 
        further and further away from Earth, there are an infinite amount of places in outer space where 
        if you looked at Earth and were able to zoom in, you'd see Halloween taking place from previous 
        years. Over a light year away, you would see last year's Halloween. A few more light years and 
        you'd see Halloween 5 years ago. You can keep going further and further away until you can see 
        Halloween from decades ago and earlier. So somewhere, a lot of “somewhere”s, in the universe, 
        it is always Halloween.
